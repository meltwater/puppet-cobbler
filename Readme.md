Puppet module for managing Cobbler
==================================

Fork of https://bitbucket.org/jsosic/puppet-cobbler

puppet-cobbler is a Puppet module used to deploy and manage Cobbler
installation(s).

Cobbler is a Linux installation server that allows for rapid setup of
network installation environments. It glues together and automates many
associated Linux tasks so you do not have to hop between lots of
various commands and applications when rolling out new systems, and, in
some cases, changing existing ones.

Puppet is an open source configuration management tool written in Ruby.

Requirements
------------

currently this module supports:  
```
Centos 6 / 7
Puppet >= 3.1.1  
Ruby   >= 1.8.7  
```

Basic usage
-----------

To install Cobbler:

    include cobbler

To add cobbler web management:

    include cobbler::web


Distros, repos, profiles and systems
------------------------------------

You can easily add distros to your Cobbler installation just by specifying
download link of ISO image and distro name:

    cobbler::add_distro { 'CentOS-6.3-x86_64':
      arch    => 'x86_64',
      isolink => 'http://mi.mirror.garr.it/mirrors/CentOS/6.3/isos/x86_64/CentOS-6.3-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso',
    }

Repos example:

    cobblerrepo { 'PuppetLabs-6-x86_64-deps':
      ensure         => present,
      arch           => 'x86_64',
      mirror         => 'http://yum.puppetlabs.com/el/6/dependencies/x86_64',
      mirror_locally => false,
      priority       => 99,
      require        => [ Service[$cobbler::service_name], Service[$cobbler::apache_service] ],
    }

Profile example:

    cobblerprofile { 'CentOS-6.3-x86_64':
      ensure      => present,
      distro      => 'CentOS-6.3-x86_64',
      nameservers => $cobbler::nameservers,
      repos       => ['PuppetLabs-6-x86_64-deps', 'PuppetLabs-6-x86_64-products' ],
      kickstart   => '/somepath/kickstarts/CentOS-6.3-x86_64-static.ks',
    }

And finally, system:

    cobblersystem { 'somehost':
      ensure     => present,
      profile    => 'CentOS-6.3-x86_64',
      interfaces => { 'eth0' => {
                        mac_address      => 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:F0',
                        interface_type   => 'bond_slave',
                        interface_master => 'bond0',
                        static           => true,
                        management       => true,
                      },
                      'eth1' => {
                        mac_address      => 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:F1',
                        interface_type   => 'bond_slave',
                        interface_master => 'bond0',
                        static           => true,
                      },
                      'bond0' => {
                        ip_address     => '192.168.1.210',
                        netmask        => '255.255.255.0',
                        static         => true,
                        interface_type => 'bond',
                        bonding_opts   => 'miimon=300 mode=1 primary=em1',
                      },
      },
      netboot    => true,
      gateway    => '192.168.1.1',
      hostname   => 'somehost.example.com',
      require    => Service[$cobbler::service_name],
    }
